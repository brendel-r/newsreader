## Context 

Building HillTop News Online has been an exciting solo project. Utilizing React, Axios, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I have created an exceptional news app for browsing and reading the latest news articles.

React provides dynamic and responsive user interfaces, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users as they explore different news categories and perform searches for specific articles. Axios simplifies the process of making API calls, allowing me to fetch news articles from the NewsAPI efficiently.

JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity, enabling users to click on articles and view detailed information and content. The app also includes a search feature to filter articles based on specific keywords, enhancing user convenience.

By combining HTML and CSS, I've crafted visually appealing web pages with a clean and intuitive design. Boredom Busters offers a diverse range of news articles, providing users with a broad selection to stay informed and entertained.

Overall, HillTop News Online is a user-friendly and feature-rich news app built to combat boredom effectively, offering a seamless browsing experience and a wide range of news articles to keep users engaged and informed.
